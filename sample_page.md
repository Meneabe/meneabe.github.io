## 2Market

**Project description:** 2Market is a global supermarket which sells products online and in store. 2Market wants to understand their customer purchase behaviour. In particular, 2Market wants to understand the demographics of their customers, which advertising channels seem to be the most effective, which products seem to sell the best and if that varies based on demographic.

This insight into 2Market customer purchase behaviour will enable 2Market to target the right customer segment and market to each group effectively and appropriately. Insight into the most effective advertising channel will enable 2Market to efficiently allocate resources to advertising. The cost or impact of not knowing 2Market customer purchase behaviour is losing customers to competitors which will impact 2Marketâ€™s bottom-line.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

Sales of 2Market products is driven by social media advertising. 

Sales growth is explained by sales of liquor.


### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

Based on the data and hypothesis that sales of 2Market products is driven by social media advertising, I made five(5) assumptions about the data and variables. The following are the assumptions:

Linearity: The relationship between the independent variable (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) and the dependent variable (sales) is linear.

Scatter plot:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(advertising_spend, sales)
plt.xlabel('Social Media Advertising Spend')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()
```
Residual plot:
After fitting the regression model, plot residuals versus the fitted values.

```
plt.scatter(model.fittedvalues, model.residuals)
plt.xlabel('Fitted values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.show()
```
Independence: Observations are independent of each other.

Durbin-Watson Test

```
from statsmodels.stats.stattools import durbin_watson
dw = durbin_watson(model.residuals)
print(f'Durbin-Watson: {dw}')
```

Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.

Residual Plot:
I used the same residual plot to check if residuals have constant variance.

```
plt.scatter(model.fittedvalues, model.residuals)
plt.xlabel('Fitted values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.show()
```
Breusch-Pagan Test:

```
from statsmodels.compat import lzip
from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import het_breuschpagan
test_stat, p_value, _, _ = het_breuschpagan(model.residuals, model.model.exog)
print(f'Breusch-Pagan test stat: {test_stat}, p-value: {p_value}')
```

Normality: The residuals are normally distributed.

Histogram of Residuals:

```
plt.hist(model.residuals, bins=30)
plt.show()
```

Q-Q Plot:

```
import statsmodels.api as sm
sm.qqplot(model.residuals, line='45')
plt.show()
```

Shapiro-Wilk Test:

```
from scipy.stats import shapiro
stat, p = shapiro(model.residuals)
print(f'Statistic={stat}, p-value={p}')
```

No Multicollinearity: The independent variables are not highly correlated (if there are multiple predictors).

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):

```
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
vif = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]
print(f'VIF: {vif}')
```

Correlation Matrix:

```
import seaborn as sns
corr_matrix = X.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True)
plt.show()
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
Based on the hypothesis and assumptions, I selected linear regression as the statistical tool and technique which will be used to assess whether sales of 2Market products is driven by social media advertising. The dependent variable or predicted variable is sales and the independent variable or predictor variable is social media that is Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

A simple linear regression model is given as below:

<img src="images/IMG_8459.jpeg"/>

Y is the dependent variable or predicted variable. For this analyses Y is sales.

X is independent variable or predictor variable. For this analyses X is Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Bo is the intercept or the predicted value of sales (Y) when all of the independent variable i.e. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is equal to zero.

B1 is the slope coefficient or the amount of increase in sales when there is a unit (1) increase in either Facebook, Instagram or Twiitter.

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments

Since the conclusion is that social media is the most effective form of advertising more than brochure (print) or e-mail channels, it will be of great benefit if data on which product type were bought through a particular social media channel is collected. Analysing this data will provide meaningful and actionable insight into which social media channel drives the sales of which product type so that targeted advertising can be deployed to drive sales and revenue even further. This approach will further aid the delivery of impactful analytics that provides real business value.
